# HW5-DayPlanner


## Description

I created this schedule planner for a user to be able to input various things on their workday schedule. The site will update daily with the correct day featured in the top section. Additionally, depending on the time of day, the hour boxes will change colors. Tan box means that the hour has already passed. Medium-brown box indicates that is the current hour. Dark-brown box means that the hour has yet to happen. 

I was really able to work on my HTML, CSS, JS, and Bootstrap skills here. I now have a greater understanding of JavaScript and how localStorage is utilized. I was able to use Bootstrap properties and add my own custom styling with CSS. I really enjoyed working on this project.

## Usage

A user will load the page and click on the specific hour box where they would like to input information. After inputing their scheduled event, they must press the save button for the data to be saved. There is a key provided for the user to understand what the hour box colors mean. The browser will remember all previously saved information for the user to return to later.
