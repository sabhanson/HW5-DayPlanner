# HW5-DayPlanner
day planner for a user to input appointments, plans, etc.

##Description

I created this schedule planner for a user to be able to input various things on their workday schedule. The site will update daily with the correct day featured in the top section. Additionally, depending on the time of day, the hour boxes will change colors. Grey box means that the hour has already passed. Red box indicates that is the current hour. Green box means that the hour has yet to happen.

##Usage

A user will load the page and click on the specific hour box where they would like to input information. The browser will remember all previously saved information for the user to return to later.
